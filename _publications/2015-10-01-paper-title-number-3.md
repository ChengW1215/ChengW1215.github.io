Methane pyrolysis is a promising sustainable technology for CO2-free hydrogen production. However, the development of stable methods for methane pyrolysis to produce hydrogen at lower temperatures has presented significant challenges. This study presents a reaction system that combines molten carbonate with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and investigates methane pyrolysis using this system in a bubble-cap reactor. Remarkably, this system exhibited a low activation energy of 145.8 kJ per mole, enabling the achievement of a methane conversion of 92.5 % at 580 Â°C by employing a double-layer bubble cap tray configuration. Furthermore, the system showcases sustained activity for a duration of up to 72 h.
